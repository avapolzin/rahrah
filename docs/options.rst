Palette/Colormap Options
========================

Each of the included palettes has been checked with `COBLIS <https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/>`_, and should be legible for individuals with most common forms of color blindness. Best, though, is to check your specific figures' readability, too.

Additional palettes and colormaps will be added moving forward. Is there a specific university you want considered for a future palette? Please open an `issue <https://github.com/avapolzin/rahrah/issues>`_ with a link to the university's branding guidelines.

About the sample images: For sequential colormaps, the sample image is photometric *HST* data of the dwarf galaxy `COSMOS-dw1 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914L..23P/abstract>`_ in F814W. The sample image for diverging colormaps is an HI velocity map of the galaxy `M33 from GALFA-HI <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703.1486P/abstract>`_.

These palettes and colormaps are designed based on university branding guidelines instead of emphasizing perceptual uniformity. Most are still pretty good in this regard, but, just for everyone's peace of mind, following ``matplotlib``, the lightness of each colormap as a function of index is shown below (all sequential maps are shown dark-to-light for easier comparison).
