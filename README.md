# `rahrah`
University-inspired matplotlib color palettes and colormaps. Colors are taken directly from University branding guidelines, so there is no specific effort toward perceptual uniformity or accessibility for color blindness. Please check your plots/figures with [COBLIS](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) or similar.

D1 schools are divided by athletic conference, with others in `rahrah.misc`. (This is simply to keep individual scripts from getting too long.)

To request the addition of a new school's palette/colormap, please open an issue, linking to the university's branding guidelines.
